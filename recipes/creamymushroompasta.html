        <h4>Creamy Pasta with mushrooms, leas and spinach.</h4>


        <p>This creamy mushroom pasta makes a healthy, super-satisfying dinner for two at just over £1 per portion. Dr Rupy uses silken tofu to give the sauce a wonderful creaminess and extra protein.</p>

                <li>olive oil, for frying</li>
                <li>1 large leek, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>200g/7oz baby leaf spinach (or frozen spinach, see Recipe Tip)</li>
                <li>200g/7oz mushrooms, thickly sliced</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>150g/5½oz silken tofu</li>
                <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

            </ul>
            
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or according to the packet instructions. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and fry the leeks gently for 5 minutes, until soft. Spoon into a bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add a little more oil to the pan, increase the heat, then add the spinach and cook for a minute or 2, until wilted. Tip the spinach out onto a plate lined with kitchen paper, cover with more kitchen paper and squeeze out the excess moisture.</li>
                    <li>Heat some more oil in the frying pan, add the mushrooms and fry over a high heat until softened and caramelised. Add the garlic, fry for a couple of minutes, then return the leeks and spinach to the pan.</li>
                    <li>Put the silken tofu and soy sauce in a tall jug and add 3 tablespoons of the reserved pasta water. Use a stick blender to blend to a smooth sauce, then pour into the pan with the mushroom mixture.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked pasta to the pan and toss everything together. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then serve.</li>
                </ol>
