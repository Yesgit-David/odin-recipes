        <li>2 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>40g/1½oz panko breadcrumbs or dry white breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>25g/1oz coconut yoghurt</li>
        <li>6 tbsp sunflower or groundnut oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 spring onion, thinly sliced on the diagonal</li>
        <li>1 tsp thin strips fresh root ginger</li>
        <li>freshly cooked rice</li>
    </ul>



    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and cook the onion for 5 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned. Add the ginger and garlic and fry for a few seconds more.</li>
        <li>Add the curry powder, turmeric and star anise and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Sprinkle over the flour and stir well. Gradually add the stock, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato purée and sugar and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and blend with a stick blender until smooth. (If you don’t have a stick blender, cool for a few minutes and blend in a food processor.)</li>
        <li>Cut the tofu into six even slices. Spread the cornflour over a small plate and sprinkle the breadcrumbs over another plate. Dust one of the tofu slices lightly in cornflour, then brush with the yoghurt.</li>
        <li>Turn the tofu in the breadcrumbs to coat on all sides, then transfer to a tray lined with baking paper. Repeat the process with the remaining tofu slices.</li>
        <li>Pour the oil into a large frying pan and set over a medium heat. Using a palette knife, gently lower the tofu slices into the hot oil. Cook for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until the breadcrumbs are crisp and golden-brown. You may need to do this in batches. Drain the tofu on kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm the sauce, adding a little extra water if needed. Divide the rice between two shallow bowls or plates and top with the tofu. Pour over a little of the sauce and serve the rest separately.</li>
    </ol>
